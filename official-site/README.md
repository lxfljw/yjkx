This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## GitHub Actions Deploy (Vercel)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow:

- [deploy-vercel.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml)

It will deploy to Vercel automatically when pushing to `main`, and also supports manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`.

### Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these repository secrets:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

You can get them from Vercel:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel Account Settings -> Tokens
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` / `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: from your Vercel project (`vercel link` / project settings)

After secrets are configured, push to `main` to trigger deployment.
